#  Full Smart Security System: AI-Driven Smartlock with Blockchain Logging

##  Overview

This project implements a **full-scale, AI-augmented, blockchain-backed smart security system** for access control in sensitive environments (e.g., ATS-secured rooms). It integrates **IoT, BLE communication, facial recognition**, **AI-based packet monitoring**, and **private blockchain logging** via **Chainlink + Hyperledger**, ensuring **traceability**, **security**, and **accountability**.

---

##  System Workflow

### 1. **Smart Lock BLE Initialization**

- The smart lock emits a unique `lockCID` over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.
- The **Flutter mobile app** (used by authorized employees) scans for this BLE signal using Flutterâ€™s `flutter_blue` package.

---

### 2. **Facial Recognition & Motion Verification**

- Once the mobile app detects the BLE signal, the user is prompted for **facial verification**.
- Motion detection is used to prevent spoofing via static images.
- The face image is sent to an **AI service**, which uses **vector comparison (ML embedding matching)** to validate identity.

---

### 3. **Access Logging on Blockchain**

- Upon successful identity verification:
  - A **Redis pub-sub event** is triggered to a **Hyperledger gateway**, which logs the access event into a **Chainlink-powered private blockchain**.
  - This ensures **tamper-proof, trustless logging** without relying solely on centralized DB admins.

---

### 4. **Door Control & Anomaly Detection**

- The IoT lock opens.
- If the door **fails to close within 6 seconds**, it triggers:
  - An alert to the backend.
  - Event logging into **Supabase**.
  - Infrared sensor checks for physical obstruction.
  - Alert forwarded to the frontend interface for visibility.

---

##  Network Security: AI-Driven Packet Inspection

- IoT traffic is monitored using **packet tracing**.
- A **LangChain-powered ML model** analyzes incoming traffic:
  - Flags suspicious packets (e.g., from unusual IPs or DDOS attempts).
  - Automatically blocks malicious IPs.
  - Sends real-time alerts to the mobile app.

---

##  Mobile App Responsibilities

- **Employee-facing Flutter app**:
  - Scans for BLE signals.
  - Handles facial recognition & verification.
  - Displays login history, failed attempts, and notifications from the AI system.

---

##  Frontend Interface

- Real-time dashboard showing:
  - Smartlock status per room.
  - Logs of access attempts (synced via Supabase).
  - Alerts and suspicious activity.
- Integrated with the blockchain to **verify trust and access legitimacy**.
